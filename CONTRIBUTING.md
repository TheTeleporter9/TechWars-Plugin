## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 16 or newer. (Refer to `pom.xml` for the exact version configured).
*   **Maven:** For building the project.
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **An IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or VS Code with Java extensions.

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/TechWars.git
    cd TechWars
    ```
2.  **Import into your IDE:** Import the project as a Maven project.

### Building the Project

To build the plugin, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will compile the code, run tests, and package the plugin into a `.jar` file (e.g., `TechWars-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) in the `target/` directory.

## Code Style and Guidelines

### Java Code Style

*   Follow Google Java Format or standard Java conventions.
*   Use clear and descriptive variable and method names.
*   Add JavaDocs for all public and protected classes, methods, and complex logic.
*   Keep methods concise and focused on a single responsibility.

### YAML Configuration Style

*   Use 2 spaces for indentation.
*   Ensure keys are descriptive and consistent.
*   Comments should explain complex sections.

### Commit Messages

We follow a conventional commit style for our commit messages (e.g., `feat: Add new research stage` or `fix: Resolve ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`).

*   **`feat`**: A new feature.
*   **`fix`**: A bug fix.
*   **`docs`**: Documentation only changes.
*   **`style`**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.).
*   **`refactor`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
*   **`perf`**: A code change that improves performance.
*   **`test`**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
*   **`build`**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g., maven, npm).
*   **`ci`**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
*   **`chore`**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
*   **`revert`**: Reverts a previous commit.
