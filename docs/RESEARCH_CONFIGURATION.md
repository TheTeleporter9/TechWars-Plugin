# Research Stage Configuration Guide

## Overview
The TechWars research system allows server hosts to create, modify, and remove research stages through the `config.yml` file. Each stage represents a technology level that teams can unlock by providing required resources.

## Configuration Structure

### Basic Structure
```yaml
ResearchTree:
  stages:
    1:  # Stage number (must be sequential)
      name: "Stage Name"
      description: "Stage Description"
      requirements:
        - item: MATERIAL_NAME
          amount: NUMBER
      unlocks:
        recipes:
          - RECIPE_NAME
        permissions:
          - "permission.node"
```

### Adding a New Stage

1. Open `config.yml`
2. Navigate to `ResearchTree.stages`
3. Add a new stage with the next sequential number
4. Configure the stage properties:

Example:
```yaml
ResearchTree:
  stages:
    3:  # Adding stage 3
      name: "Advanced Mining"
      description: "Unlocks diamond tool crafting"
      requirements:
        - item: IRON_PICKAXE
          amount: 1
        - item: DIAMOND
          amount: 5
      unlocks:
        recipes:
          - DIAMOND_PICKAXE
          - DIAMOND_SHOVEL
        permissions:
          - "techwars.craft.diamond"
```

### Removing a Stage

1. Open `config.yml`
2. Navigate to `ResearchTree.stages`
3. Remove the stage entry
4. **Important**: Renumber remaining stages to maintain sequential order
5. Restart the server or use `/techwars reload`

### Valid Material Names
Use official Minecraft material names, for example:
- DIAMOND
- IRON_INGOT
- COBBLESTONE
- REDSTONE
- OBSIDIAN

### Valid Recipe Names
Use official Minecraft recipe names, matching the items you want to unlock, for example:
- DIAMOND_PICKAXE
- IRON_SWORD
- ENCHANTING_TABLE

## Best Practices

1. **Sequential Numbering**
   - Always number stages sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
   - No gaps allowed between numbers
   - Stage numbers determine progression path

2. **Requirements**
   - Use obtainable materials
   - Balance amounts carefully
   - Consider progression difficulty

3. **Unlocks**
   - Make unlocks meaningful
   - Balance with requirements
   - Use correct permission nodes

4. **Testing**
   - Test new stages before deployment
   - Use `/researchadmin test <team>` to verify requirements
   - Check unlock functionality

## Example Configuration

```yaml
ResearchTree:
  stages:
    1:
      name: "Stone Age"
      description: "Basic stone tools"
      requirements:
        - item: COBBLESTONE
          amount: 32
        - item: STICK
          amount: 16
      unlocks:
        recipes:
          - STONE_PICKAXE
          - STONE_AXE
        permissions:
          - "techwars.craft.stone"

    2:
      name: "Iron Age"
      description: "Iron tool crafting"
      requirements:
        - item: IRON_INGOT
          amount: 16
        - item: FURNACE
          amount: 1
      unlocks:
        recipes:
          - IRON_PICKAXE
          - IRON_AXE
        permissions:
          - "techwars.craft.iron"

    3:
      name: "Diamond Age"
      description: "Diamond tools"
      requirements:
        - item: DIAMOND
          amount: 8
        - item: OBSIDIAN
          amount: 4
      unlocks:
        recipes:
          - DIAMOND_PICKAXE
