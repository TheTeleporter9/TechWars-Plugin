# TechWars Plugin

## Overview

TechWars is a Minecraft plugin designed to introduce a dynamic research and team-based progression system to your server. Players form teams, engage in research to unlock new technologies, recipes, and permissions, and compete to advance through various stages. This plugin aims to provide a unique gameplay experience by integrating strategic elements with traditional Minecraft survival.

## Features

*   **Team System:** Players can form and manage teams, with integrated chat and data storage.
*   **Research Tree:** A customizable research tree defined in `config.yml` where teams unlock stages by submitting required resources.
*   **Dynamic UI:** Interactive in-game menus for the research tree and upgrade process.
*   **Developer Tools:** Comprehensive in-game menus and commands for administrators to manage teams, research progress, and plugin data.
*   **Configurable:** Highly customizable via `config.yml` for stages, requirements, and unlocks.
